# Corporate Actions Registry
#
# Purpose: Record token redenominations, splits, and other corporate actions
# that cause apparent extreme price changes in historical data.
#
# Usage: The backtest loader applies price adjustments to historical data
# so that returns are computed on a consistent unit basis.
#
# Schema:
#   market: Market identifier (e.g., binance_spot, binance_futures)
#   symbol: Symbol name as it appears in normalized data
#   date: Effective date of the action (YYYY-MM-DD)
#   action_type: Type of action (redenomination, split, reverse_split)
#   ratio: Conversion ratio (e.g., 1000 means 1 old = 1000 new)
#   note: Human-readable description
#   source_refs: List of reference sources (announcements, support articles)
#
# Adjustment Logic:
#   For action_type in [redenomination, split]:
#     - Dates BEFORE action_date: close = close / ratio
#     - This converts old units to new units for consistent returns
#   For action_type in [reverse_split]:
#     - Dates BEFORE action_date: close = close * ratio
